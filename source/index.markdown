### Welcome!

I am a software developer and have been one for more than a decade now at the <a href="#" title="2013-02-24 01:00" onclick="return false;">time</a> of this writing. I love web technologies in general with a growing favoritism towards the richness on the client side stuff, though have been faring quite okay with .NET/C# as well.

Have been doing a little bit of Android/PhoneGap/jQuery-Mobile kinda stuff off late and would love to keep doing more of these. Learning Ruby has been another thing I've been yearning to do for quite some time and I hope I would get around to doing that real soon. I have also done a more-than-fair share of good ol' mainframes for the first few years, and would like to see that as bygone.

I love StackOverflow, GitHub, Hacker News and Twitter (not necessarily in that order).

I hope to be a CTO-ish someone of something-big, founded by myself, one day!

### Projects

The few that are worthy of mention:

 - [flickr downloadr](http://flickrdownloadr.com) - A flickr download manager for Windows, conceived from a personal need.
 - [Travis CI Mobile](http://floydpink.github.com/Travis-CI/) - Android & iOS applications (done in PhoneGap) for Travis CI.
 - [lzwCompress.js](http://floydpink.github.com/lzwCompress.js/) - A compression utility spun off from one of the projects I worked for.

Check out my profile at GitHub for all the stuff that I fork and push to.
