### Welcome and [Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)!

I am a polyglot developer and have been hacking at things for over fifteen years now at the <a href="#" title="2017-03-23 13:06" onclick="return false;">time</a> of updating this page. I love building things with technology, especially, architecting scalable, highly performing, multi-tier solutions and I strive for rich user experiences in all of the applications I build.

`C#` and `.NET` have been my bread and butter for quite some time now, with increasing focus into `Microsoft Azure`, `Windows Store Apps` and a little bit of cross-platform fun with `Xamarin`. I am excited that the projects from my day job has been allowing me to work with more of `iOS`/`Android`/`Web Development` projects these days.

Outside of my job, I have also been contributing to [a few Open Source projects](https://github.com/floydpink) - especially in `NodeJS`/`.NET`/`iOS`/`Android`/`Web` categories and would definitely love to keep doing more of this. Have done a fair bit of `AngularJS` & `EmberJS` and using these to write powerful web and/or desktop/mobile apps (with tools like `PhoneGap`/`Cordova`, `nw.js`, `electron` from GitHub etc.) is what's been keeping me busy off late.

`Swift`, the new language from Apple for iOS/Mac OS X development is definitely much more excitng and interesting than working with its kludgy predecessor - `Objective-C`. `JavaScript`, `C#`, `Java`, `Swift`, `Objective-C` are the languages that I work with and love them possibly in that order. `WebStorm` from JetBrains has been my favorite IDE for quite some time now and `Visual Studio` (along with `ReSharper` from JetBrains) is also one the best development tools I have used.

`Android Studio` from Google (built on the `IntelliJ` platform from JetBrains) is what I use for the little bit of `Android` development I do. I have also been using quite a bit of the `AppCode` IDE (JetBrains again) which seems to so much better than Apple's free IDE - `Xcode`.

### Projects

These are the few that I think are worthy of a mention here:

 - [flickr downloadr](http://flickrdownloadr.com) - A flickr download manager for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux conceived from a personal need.
 - [kollavarsham](http://kollavarsham.org) - Open Source libraries for Kollavarsham a.k.a. [Malayalam Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_calendar) calendar.
 - [Bhagavad Gita](http://floydpink.github.io/BhagavadGita) - Android, iOS, Apple iBooks and web versions of [Srimad Bhagavad Gita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita) in [Malayalam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam).
 - [lzwCompress.js](http://floydpink.github.io/lzwCompress.js) - A compression utility spun off from one of the projects I worked for.
 - [Cached Image](https://github.com/floydpink/CachedImage) - A WPF control that wraps the native Image control to enable file-system based caching.
 - [Mantis CI](http://floydpink.github.io/Mantis-CI/) - Android & iOS applications (done in PhoneGap and ember.js) for Travis CI (not maintaining this anymore).
