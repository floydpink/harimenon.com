### Welcome!

Hello, and a warm welcome to you!

I am a software developer and have been one for more than a decade now at the <a href="#" title="2013-02-24 01:00" onclick="return false;">time</a> of this writing. I love web technologies in general with a growing bias towards the client side richness, though have been faring quite okay with .NET/C# as well.

Have been doing a little bit of Android/PhoneGap/jQuery-Mobile kinda stuff recently and would love to keep doing more of this. Learning Ruby has been another thing I've been yearning to do for quite some time, I hope I would get around to doing that soon. I have also done my more-than-fair share of good ol' mainframes for the first few years, and would like to see that as bygone.

I love StackOverflow, GitHub, Hacker News and Twitter (not necessarily in that order).

Hope that I would get into being a CTO-ish someone of something-big, founded by myself, one day!

### Projects

The few that are worthy of mention:

 - [flickr downloadr](http://flickrdownloadr.com) - A flickr download manager for Windows, conceived from a personal need.
 - [Travis CI](http://floydpink.github.com/Travis-CI/) - Prenatal stages of what would be an Android app for the awesome Travis CI.
 - [lzwCompress.js](http://floydpink.github.com/lzwCompress.js/) - A compression utility spun off from one of the projects I worked for.

Check out my profile at GitHub for all the stuff that I fork and push to.

#### Little History

Earlier, when the site was hosted with blogger, there were a few pages, each of which was a subdomain hosted as a distinct blog on blogger with custom domain names. But now, since the site has moved into the [Octopress](http://octopress.org) platform, all of the old posts from the three old blogs - [malayalam](/blog/categories/malayalam-blog/), [english](/blog/categories/english-blog/) and [technical](/blog/categories/technical/), have been merged into one single blog and the categories/tags are what would distinguish them. The content of the old home page has been archived [here](/bloggerhome), and it's preserved in its exact form [at blogger](http://harimenonhome.blogspot.com)!

Have a beautiful day!
