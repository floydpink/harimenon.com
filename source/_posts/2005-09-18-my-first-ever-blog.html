Well... Yeah ! This is my first ever Blog post !!! It defintely is close to the end of 2005 and Blogging is by now one of the the most happening things on the internet. Maybe, it is just that I got to know of this pretty late... Or even that I just kept myself aside so far... And creating some time for this, I couldnt, perhaps...<br />Sitting now here in GE Money Bank's office in Prague on a Sunday afternoon, though, time is all that I have !<br />And for theme of my blog, I do have this one which I cherish the most and practice very dearly to my day-to-day life - Spirituality.<br />Will come back here later to scribble down whatever comes into my mind, but this much I guess is good enough to start off !</div>
