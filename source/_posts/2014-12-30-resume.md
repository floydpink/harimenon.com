I love Stack Overflow, probably because I am passionate about technology.  Photography, music, spirituality are my other passions and all of these together makes me feel I am alive. 

I try to write a little on my blog about many different things - check it out [here](https://www.harimenon.com/blog)

You could also read a little more about me at my [about.me](http://about.me/hpachuveetil) page.

Stay beautiful !

I am currently employed and not actively looking for a switch, but feel free to let me know if you have an offer that you think I cannot resist!

There were a couple of custom web parts, SharePoint branding was used to match the existing intranet look and there was port of an existing ASP.NET web form application that was ported into InfoPath Forms Services.

The second project was for a big name from the banking sector in the North Eastern US located at Bridgeport, CT, where quite a slew of their existing Lotus Notes forms were getting migrated into SharePoint (as InfoPath forms initially, and towards the end as web forms built on a custom ASP.NET form framework, for performance reasons). Was one of the senior developers in the team of 8, singly responsible for the custom built forms framework that was consumed by the entire group.
