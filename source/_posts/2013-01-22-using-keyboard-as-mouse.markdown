Here's how to get the mouse functionality using just the keyboard (with Numpad) on Windows:
<small>{% blockquote halviti http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5097490 An HN Comment %}One good one to remember is ALT+Left Shift+NumLock
Then you can use your keypad as a mouse. / and - toggle which mouse button 5 is.{% endblockquote %}</small>

Could be useful sometime...
