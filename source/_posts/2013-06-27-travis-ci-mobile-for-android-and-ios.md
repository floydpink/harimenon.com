For a while now, the mobile port of the [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) web application packaged as a [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) application has been available for Android [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floydpink.android.travisci).

Recently I started working on an iOS variant of the same and thanks to detailed guides at PhoneGap and a lot of good questions on StackOverflow, completing the port was not a huge deal. It was good learning experience in trying to the do similar things that worked on the Linux/Eclipse/Android track on to the Mac/Xcode/iOS one.

The app had been in the store and waiting for review/approval since 06/24 and finally it has been approved today! Yay!

You could read more about the app and its features [here](http://floydpink.github.io/Travis-CI/).

Click on the below buttons to download it from one of the app stores:
