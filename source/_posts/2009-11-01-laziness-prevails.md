Been a while since I’ve scribbled down something in here. The personal & professional fronts of my life have been so occupied for the past few months, that I’ve kind of eloped from my online life altogether for the said period. Even with this confession though, I am gonna be missing in action for another few months. 

Stay beautiful !
