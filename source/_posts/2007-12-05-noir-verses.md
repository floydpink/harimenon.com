Is it perhaps the quietude of Night?
Or maybe the ubiquitous ingenuousness in sight?
What if I find all of my kind so grossly impure?
How can I break the spell, so severe?
Nox, to whom all the sins of men are in a state of respite...
The only time they take a break, despite...
The disposition so conspicuously austere...
Can't just fall in love, albeit so mere...

The I in Me, is he nocturnal?
If not, why is he so detrimental?
Then, when you are one with the universe !
The very fake colours & sound, all really scarce !
Dark futility that stares at you is eternal...
Ambushed in the clandestine shadows, so ephemeral...
All this is but just a personal somnolence !
When would I be transcending my evanescence !
