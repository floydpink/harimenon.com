<em>If you can keep your head when all about you<br />Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you<br />But make allowance for their doubting too,<br />If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br />Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br />And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br /><br />If you can dream - and not make dreams your master,<br />If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;<br />If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />And treat those two impostors just the same;<br />If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br />Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:<br /><br />If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"<br /><br />If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch,<br />If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br />If all men count with you, but none too much,<br />If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br />Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br />And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son! </em><br /><br />- Rudyard Kipling
