Here's how to get the mouse functionality using just the keyboard (with Numpad) on Windows:
<small>{% blockquote halviti http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5097490 An HN Comment %}One good one to remember is <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Left Shift</kbd>+<kbd>NumLock</kbd>
Then you can use your keypad as a mouse. <kbd>/</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> toggle which mouse button <kbd>5</kbd> is.{% endblockquote %}</small>

Could be useful sometime...
