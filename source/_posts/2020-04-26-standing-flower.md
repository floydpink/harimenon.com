{% img /images/standing-flower-maya-20200426.png 600 'Standing Flower' %}

A painting by my 9yo using [this app](https://www.youidraw.com/apps/painter/). In her own words:

> This picture is about a standing flower and there is a hurricane and it wants to take the flower out. And speaking of which please stay safe. Stay inside.
