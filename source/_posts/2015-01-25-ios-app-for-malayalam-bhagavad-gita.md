> iOS app as a Malayalam eBook on Srimad Bhagavad Gita

Published an open source iOS app last week that is a port of [my earlier Android app](https://harimenon.com/2014/09/10/android-app-for-malayalam-bhagavad-gita/) - essentially an eBook in Malayalam on Srimad Bhagavad Gita:

<div style="text-align:center;">
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bhagavad-gita-malayalam/id953008948?mt=8&uo=4" target="_blank" style="display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://floydpink.github.io/BhagavadGita/images/app-store.png) no-repeat;width:203px;height:60px;background-position:center;"></a>
    <span style="color:#999;font-size:smaller">Download on the App Store</span>
</div>

The source is available on GitHub - https://github.com/floydpink/BhagavadGita-ios

As mentioned in the earlier post, this started out as [an Apple iBooks project](https://github.com/floydpink/BhagavadGita/tree/apple-ibooks) that unfortunately did not get through the Apple review system for the reason that Malayalam is not yet a supported language for iBooks.

Had fun with developing this for iOS8+ devices in Apple's new language - `Swift`

Hope this would be useful for some!
