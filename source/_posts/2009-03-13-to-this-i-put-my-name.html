<div class='post'>
<span><em>'That ... be not told of my death,<br />Or made to grieve on account of me,<br />And that I be not buried in consecrated ground,<br />And that no sexton be asked to toll the bell,<br />And that nobody is wished to see my dead body,<br />And that no mourners walk behind me at my funeral,<br />And that no flowers be planted on my grave,<br />And that no man remember me,<br />To this I put my name.'<br /></em><br />- Thomas Hardy</span>
