## Android app as a Malayalam eBook on Srimad Bhagavad Gita

Published a new, open source Android app last week that is essentially an eBook in Malayalam on Srimad Bhagavad Gita:

[![Android app on Google Play](https://floydpink.github.io/BhagavadGita/images/play-store.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floydpink.android.bhagavadgita)

The source is available on GitHub - https://github.com/floydpink/BhagavadGita-android

This started out as [an Apple iBooks project](https://github.com/floydpink/BhagavadGita/tree/apple-ibooks) that unfortunately did not get through the Apple review system for the reason that Malayalam is not yet a supported language for iBooks.

Planning on porting this as an iOS app for both iPhones and iPads soon.
