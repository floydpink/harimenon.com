### Welcome and [Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)!

I am a polyglot developer and have been hacking on software for over nineteen years now at the <a href="#" title="2020-08-16 09:29" onclick="return false;">time</a> of updating this page. I love building things with technology, especially architecting scalable, highly performant, multi-tier solutions and I strive for rich user experiences in all of the applications I build.

#### Contact Me

Here are the links to my profiles on some of the tech/social sites. Connect with me on any of these or send me an email to 'me@&lt;this-site's-domain&gt;'.

#### Technical Experience

`Node.js`, `C#` and `.NET` have been my bread and butter for quite some time now, with an increased focus on cloud based applications (especially `AWS`), for quite some time now. Until a few months ago, my day job used to be working on a pretty large, distributed web app that mostly satisfies the guidelines to be called a [twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/).

Outside of my job, I was fortunate in contributing to [a few Open Source projects](https://github.com/floydpink) - especially in `NodeJS`/`.NET`/`iOS`/`Android`/`Web` etc. Have done a fair bit of `Aurelia`, `Angular` & `Ember` and I used to write web and/or desktop/mobile apps (with tools like `PhoneGap`/`Cordova`, `nw.js`/`electron` etc.). Off late though, I haven't been able to find as much time as I would like on these OSS projects.

#### Some of my side projects

These are the few that I think are worthy of a mention here:

 - [kollavarsham](http://kollavarsham.org) - Open Source libraries for Kollavarsham a.k.a. [Malayalam Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_calendar) calendar.
 - [Bhagavad Gita](http://floydpink.github.io/BhagavadGita) - Android, iOS, Apple iBooks and web versions of [Srimad Bhagavad Gita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita) in [Malayalam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam).
 - [lzwCompress.js](http://floydpink.github.io/lzwCompress.js) - A compression utility spun off from one of the projects I worked for.
 - [Cached Image](https://github.com/floydpink/CachedImage) - A WPF control that wraps the native Image control to enable file-system based caching.
 ~~- [flickr downloadr](http://flickrdownloadr.com) - A flickr download manager for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux conceived from a personal need.~~ (not maintaining this anymore).
 ~~- [Mantis CI](http://floydpink.github.io/Mantis-CI/) - Android & iOS applications (done in PhoneGap and ember.js) for Travis CI~~ (not maintaining this anymore).

Check out my GitHub profile for all the bits I contribute to.

###### Meta

Quite a while ago, I moved this blog from [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) into [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) and have been loving it.

I was actively using Octopress for quite a while and this blog was [being built dynamically](https://harimenon.com/2013/01/27/auto-deploying-to-my-octopress-blog/) every time [the source repository](https://github.com/floydpink/harimenon.com) is modified and pushed to. ~~I'd soon hope to get the same done with Hexo.~~ The Hexo version is also [now being built](https://github.com/floydpink/harimenon.com/blob/master/.travis.yml) dynamically on every push to GitHub.

The content of the old home page has been archived [here](/bloggerhome), and it's preserved in its exact form [at blogger](http://harimenonhome.blogspot.com)! You could also see the history of this page [on GitHub](https://github.com/floydpink/harimenon.com/commits/master/source/index.markdown)

Have a wonderful day!
