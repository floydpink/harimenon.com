### Welcome and [Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)!

I am a polyglot developer and have been hacking at things for over fifteen years now at the <a href="#" title="2017-03-23 22:06" onclick="return false;">time</a> of updating this page. I love building things with technology, especially architecting scalable, highly performant, multi-tier solutions and I strive for rich user experiences in all of the applications I build.

#### Contact Me

Here are the links to my profiles on some of the tech/social sites. Connect with me on any of these or send me an email to 'me@&lt;this-site's-domain&gt;'.

#### Technical Experience

`C#` and `.NET` have been my bread and butter for quite some time now, with an increased focus into `Microsoft Azure`, `Windows Store Apps` `Xamarin` etc. for a little while in between. Until about a year or so ago, my day job used to be building on native mobile apps on all of `iOS`/`Android` and `Windows` platforms; but I am presently working on a pretty large, distributed web app that mostly satisfies the guidelines to be called a [twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/).

Outside of my job, I have also been contributing to [a few Open Source projects](https://github.com/floydpink) - especially in `NodeJS`/`.NET`/`iOS`/`Android`/`Web` categories and would definitely love to keep doing more of this. Have done a fair bit of `Aurelia`, `Angular` & `Ember` and I used to write powerful web and/or desktop/mobile apps (with tools like `PhoneGap`/`Cordova`, `nw.js`/`electron` etc.). Off late though, I haven't been able to find as much time as I would like on these OSS projects.

#### iOS and Android development

`Swift`, the new language from Apple for iOS/Mac OS X development is definitely much more exciting and interesting than working with its kludgy predecessor - `Objective-C`. `JavaScript`, `C#`, `Java`, `Swift`, `Objective-C` are the languages that I work with and love them possibly in that order. `WebStorm` from JetBrains has been my favorite IDE for quite some time now and `Visual Studio` (along with `ReSharper` from JetBrains) is also one the best development tools I have used.

`Android Studio` from Google (built on the `IntelliJ` platform from JetBrains) is what I use for the little bit of `Android` development I do. I have also been using quite a bit of the `AppCode` IDE (JetBrains again) which seems to so much better than Apple's free IDE - `Xcode`.

#### Some of my side projects

These are the few that I think are worthy of a mention here:

 - [flickr downloadr](http://flickrdownloadr.com) - A flickr download manager for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux conceived from a personal need.
 - [kollavarsham](http://kollavarsham.org) - Open Source libraries for Kollavarsham a.k.a. [Malayalam Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_calendar) calendar.
 - [Bhagavad Gita](http://floydpink.github.io/BhagavadGita) - Android, iOS, Apple iBooks and web versions of [Srimad Bhagavad Gita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita) in [Malayalam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam).
 - [lzwCompress.js](http://floydpink.github.io/lzwCompress.js) - A compression utility spun off from one of the projects I worked for.
 - [Cached Image](https://github.com/floydpink/CachedImage) - A WPF control that wraps the native Image control to enable file-system based caching.
 - [Mantis CI](http://floydpink.github.io/Mantis-CI/) - Android & iOS applications (done in PhoneGap and ember.js) for Travis CI (not maintaining this anymore).

Check out my GitHub profile for all the stuff that I fork and push to.

###### Meta

Recently I moved this blog from [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) into [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) and have been loving it.

I was actively using Octopress for quite a while and this blog was [being built dynamically](https://harimenon.com/2013/01/27/auto-deploying-to-my-octopress-blog/) every time [the source repository](https://github.com/floydpink/harimenon.com) is modified and pushed to. I'd soon hope to get the same done with Hexo.

The content of the old home page has been archived [here](/bloggerhome), and it's preserved in its exact form [at blogger](http://harimenonhome.blogspot.com)! You could also see the history of this page [on GitHub](https://github.com/floydpink/harimenon.com/commits/master/source/index.markdown)

Have a blessed day!
