Thank you for the visit and welcome to the small space that I have on the web. Please make yourself comfortable and have a look around and do leave some comments/feedback on what you see if you could spare the time.

I am trying to be regular with the posts on the two blogs here - [one in English](http://en.blog.harimenon.com/) and [another in Malayalam](http://ml.blog.harimenon.com/). If you notice something in whatever you read in these blogs, that shouldn't have been, I would appreciate it very much if you would kindly point it out to me. Encouraging comments and helpful tips are also much appreciated, as I see myself as a nervous beginner in this original-writing front.

Apart from these, I have some [photos on flickr](http://flickr.harimenon.com/) that I have posted there over the last 4 years. Haven't been able to click any photos recently for the lack of a camera. Am waiting for the savings for my next camera, to pile up to the price for the brand(s) and model(s) I have in my mind.

I like to read books on a varied range of topics in English and Malayalam and have been meaning to put up a post with the list of books I have read, liked and always-wanted-to-read and all. There are services now on the social networking sites, but none have been good enough yet for my liking and linking here.

I also watch a lot of movies and listen to my genres of music whenever find time to. Malayalam, English, Tamil and Hindi movies are what I try to follow in that order and there are no specific genres that I would stick to. I listen to a few selected Rock/Metal artists, Malayalam film music, Indian classical music, and Original Motion Picture Scores from the movies I love.

Spirituality has also been something that always fascinates my mind, and I became aware of this after reading Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now. Have tried to read quite a few books on spirituality/philosophy since then, but has observed that original stuff that moves the reader is rare to get on this topic.

If you'd like, you could hook up with me on Twitter ([@menonHari](http://twitter.com/menonHari)) and on Facebook ([menonHari](http://www.facebook.com/menonhari))

Thanks once again for the visit. Hope I would see you here again. Have a good one. :o)
